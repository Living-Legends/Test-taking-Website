Python Test Taking Software created for Guided Design in Software Engineering course- CS490 

Software includes login page sessions for student and teachers.

Teachers are to log into a specialized screen where they can view students, here they can

Fill a question bank and put them into classifying categories.
Create an Exam using the question bank and release it to students, or keep it private.

Submit test cases. 

Students login shows takable exams.
A text box is given for each question, there is one question per screen.
Point values and constraint type, if any, are presented.
Students must use correct tabing and Python syntax. 

Once submitted, the teacher can see which students took the exam. 
They are able to either manually grade the student's answers or deploy autograding software.

Autograding works by sending the student answer and writing it into a python file.
A loop appends the test cases into the Python file and it is executed. 
If the execution gives the expected answer, student recieves full allocated points.
If not, student recieves 0 for test case.

If the constraint is not met, they will recieve 0 points for the constraint. 

Teacher can chose to overide points given by autograder.
Teacher can always write comments for each question that the student will see. 
Teacher can chose to release the grades to the students.

Students are able to see their answer, the teacher comments, if any, and their grade for the exam.
